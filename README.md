# The-Return-at-the-Yeti

### The project involves building a predictive model to address the drop in sales faced by Yeti-Travel, a travel agency that specializes in school trips. The model will use historical data of loyal customers to identify their most relevant features and predict churn probability. The available data is from three different divisions: Sales, Finance, and CRM. The project is organized into three stages: gathering data, developing the model, and analyzing informative features. Two zip files with past labeled data and new unlabeled data are provided.
